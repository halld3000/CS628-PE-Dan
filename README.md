TodoList.js has functions to add and delete task, it displays the input field and add task button. Captures user input and sends it back to App.js. Renders a list of TodoItem compnents dynamically using .map(). TodoItem.js represents a single ToDo item, contains the task delet button. Calls the deleteTodo function and passes it to App.js.
